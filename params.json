HoboNickels (HBN) is an extremely fast and efficient crypto-currency. With a Proof of Work block time of 30 seconds coupled with fast Proof of Stake, it is pushing to be one of the fastest coins available. The 2-5% Proof of Stake is also one of the most generous staking algorithms released. The stake is designed to keep the inflation rate from getting out of control, with the % of stake decreasing as more people stake the coin. HoboNickels has the added security of a Proof of Stake coin with the addition of security features like Automated Block Checkpoints. HoboNickels are the first coin to use Multi-Wallet functionality.\r\n\r\n## Installation:\r\n\r\nFrom source use\r\n\r\n    $ python setup.py install\r\n\r\nor install from PyPi\r\n\r\n    $ pip install hobonickels\r\n\r\n## API Documentation:\r\n\r\nThis API can currently retrieve the following stats from [hbn.blockx.info](http://hbn.blockx.info/) and [CryptoCoin](http://www.cryptocoincharts.info)\r\n\r\nWork in progress\r\n\r\n## License:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  Apache v2.0 License\r\n  Copyright 2014 Martin Simon\r\n\r\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n   limitations under the License.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Useful links:\r\n\r\n* [Hobonickels website](http://www.hobonickels.info/)\r\n* [Hobonickels Blockexplorer](http://hbn.blockx.info/)\r\n\r\n## Buy me a coffee?\r\n\r\nIf you feel like buying me a coffee (or a beer?), donations are welcome:\r\n\r\n```\r\nF2Zs4igv8r4oJJzh4sh4bGmeqoUxLQHPki\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
